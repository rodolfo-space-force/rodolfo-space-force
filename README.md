## Profile

Aerospace systems specialist with an M.Sc. in Aerospace Sciences (Brazilian Air Force University – UNIFA), focused on launch vehicle performance, orbital mechanics, and space systems risk modeling.

My work centers on analytical and computational modeling for:

• Launch vehicle trajectory simulation  
• ΔV budgeting and loss analysis (gravity, drag, steering)  
• Orbit determination using Extended Kalman Filter (J2 perturbation)  
• TLE propagation and debris tracking (SGP4)  
• Monte Carlo–based orbital risk assessment  
• Space Domain Awareness (SDA) modeling  

I develop simulation frameworks in Python and C++, integrating numerical methods, perturbation models, and statistical validation approaches for mission analysis and performance evaluation.
